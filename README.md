# SolarSystem
Simulation of a Solar System

## Graphic Details 
> Sun placed in the center of the simulation with an omnidirectional source of light in its core, sun skin applied along with the sun rays
> All the planets gravitate around it with their own graphic skins, portraying the light and dark part of each 
> A static background with a galaxy theme
> Simple menu with a button and title to the application

## Functionalities
> Menu with a button for entering the application
> Camera for navigating the scene from several angles, powered by WASD and mouse movement
> Planets circle the sun with different speeds, randomized every time the application is run for realistic effect
> Planets revolve around their own axis as well, speed is chosen randomly for every applications start
> Canvas was used for the menu, with placement for graphic effect and function for starting the application on button press
> 2 Scenes for the Menu and for the Simulation itself

## Applications Used
> VS2019 for building C# script
> Unity 2021 for Simulation Interface
> Skins for planets were downloaded in packs
